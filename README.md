# PHP Unexpected Array Access Behavior with Non-Numeric Keys
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to accessing array elements using integer indices when the array keys are strings. The issue causes unexpected behavior and silent failures, potentially leading to difficult-to-debug issues in PHP applications.

## The Bug
The bug occurs when an associative array (with string keys) is accessed using an integer index. Instead of throwing an error or returning the first element, PHP returns null. This is different from how many developers expect arrays to function.

## The Solution
The solution involves using explicit string keys to access array elements when dealing with associative arrays, or iterating through the array using `foreach` for a safer approach. Using `isset()` to check for the existence of a key helps in avoiding unexpected null values.
